# Projects

#### Computer Vision
 - [Face counting project](https://github.com/lukazambuca/Projects/tree/master/Face_counting). Implementing a relatively simple pre-trained face detection using the Haar Cascades algortithm. 
 - [Tutorial](https://github.com/lukazambuca/Projects/tree/master/MNIST) on popular MNIST dataset
#### Machine learning 
- [Nigerian Insurance challenge](https://github.com/lukazambuca/Projects/blob/master/Insurance_Nigeria_tune.ipynb). XGboost was used, in combination with several functions to tune the hyperparameters of the model. 
- [Cluster neighbourhoods](https://github.com/lukazambuca/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/%20Capstone%20Project%20-%20The%20Battle%20of%20Neighborhoods%20(Week%201).ipynb) to decide which is the best to live in, depending on factors such as safety, shops, convenience etc
